# Agent scenarios

This catalogue asks whether agents can express real model-selection requests through ModelSpec and explain the evidence accurately. It contains 74 scenarios covering Jamie's four families and every one of the 40 decide templates. The harness reports results; fixture success rates do not gate model quality.

## Run offline

Use the repository's test environment:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=$PWD /Users/terbeest/dev/modelspec/.venv/bin/python -m qa.agent_harness --dry-run
PYTHONPATH=$PWD /Users/terbeest/dev/modelspec/.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_agent_harness.py -q
```

The default report directory is `qa/reports`. `--date YYYY-MM-DD` controls the filename. `--agent claude`, `--agent openai`, and `--agent gemini` restrict the selected agents; repeat the flag to select several. Repeat `--scenario <id>` to select tasks. Caps are `--turn-cap`, `--tool-call-cap`, and `--spend-cap`.

Dry-run reads compressed fixtures and makes no network requests. API fixtures are recorded from the real decision engine using public repository inputs. Agent turns, judge replies, token counts and errors introduced into requests are scripted. Each local engine duration is captured once and replayed. They are not API network latency measurements. The fixture judge deliberately fails the full rubric because the short scripted answers lack offering-level evidence. Its configured model id identifies which judge would run live; `mode: scripted` distinguishes the replay.

To inspect or regenerate fixtures:

```sh
gzip -dc qa/fixtures/replay.json.gz > /tmp/model-268-fixtures.json
PYTHONPATH=$PWD /Users/terbeest/dev/modelspec/.venv/bin/python -m qa.record_fixtures
PYTHONPATH=$PWD /Users/terbeest/dev/modelspec/.venv/bin/python -m qa.contracts
```

The generator uses the same public premier snapshot builder as recall, records any completeness gaps, and never reads keys or calls HTTP. It records full engine responses; it does not derive recommendations from approved expectations. The MCP capture takes descriptions from `mcp/src/server.ts`, the decision schema from the committed contract, and mirrors the other registered Zod inputs. Source hashes and a test reject drift. Changes to a Zod input require reviewing the mirror in `qa/contracts.py` before refreshing it.

## Run against a nonproduction deployment

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `MODELSPEC_API_KEY` in your environment. Configure the API and static export origins and model ids in a copy of `qa/config.yaml`. Only the selected agents' keys and the separate judge's key are required. The default judge uses OpenAI, so a Claude-only run also needs `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

```sh
python -m qa.agent_harness --config /tmp/model-268-staging.yaml \
  --api-base-url https://your-staging-worker.example \
  --export-base-url https://your-staging-export.example \
  --output-dir /tmp/model-268-private-reports
```

The runner refuses known production ModelSpec hosts and follows no redirects. It uses plain HTTP with Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Responses, and Gemini `generateContent`. The agent receives only the user request and constraints, a short ModelSpec system note, the committed OpenAPI document, and the seven MCP tools. Expectations, rubrics, source specs and gap annotations are withheld. Tools forward to configured origins and preserve origin envelopes, validation errors and unknowns. The shim mirrors the MCP's split-data setting and nested Zod field stripping. `data_split: false` and `vocabulary_path: /api/decision/vocabulary.json` select the static export path.

The live judge is a separate stateless model call with the final answer, tool evidence, scenario rubric and any approved expected evidence. It extracts the final top recommendation or tied set, then assesses constraints, ties and uncertainty. A run succeeds only when the rubric passes and its recommendation is acceptable where independent evidence exists. Recall's acceptable sets are unordered; any nonempty top subset can match. The rubric handles confidence, prohibited candidates and unknown candidates. An abstention matches recall only where an explicit rule permits it. Scenarios with `expected: null` are judged by their rubric alone.

The $25 default cap applies to the entire invocation, including judges. The price table stores USD per million tokens. A call reserves a conservative UTF-8-byte input bound plus protocol overhead and the output cap at ceiling rates before HTTP. Successful calls settle using reported tokens, including cached input and reasoning output. Contexts over 200,000 input tokens use ceiling rates. Missing usage or a transport failure retains the full reservation and ends that scenario. There are no hidden SDK retries. Update both price and ceiling tables from vendor docs before a paid run. This is an estimated token-spend limit, not a substitute for vendor account limits or a cap on separately priced ModelSpec credits.

Model defaults and prices were checked on 2026-10-01 against [Anthropic Sonnet 5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/models/sonnet-5/overview), [Anthropic pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing), [OpenAI GPT-6.1 Sol](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-6.1-sol), and [Gemini models and pricing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing). OpenAI uses Responses because GPT-6.1 Sol's Chat Completions endpoint does not support tools. It preserves encrypted reasoning items; Gemini preserves thought signatures between tool turns.

## Inspect reports

The Markdown report summarizes success per family and agent, mean tool calls, nearest-rank p50/p95 latency, misuse counts, and contract gaps with proposed fixes. The JSON includes each family × agent intersection and every run's ordered calls, retries, errors, tokens, wall time, costs, final answer, judge model and result. Tool response bodies are stored once in `tool_responses`; each call's `response_ref` identifies its response. `unknown_facets` contains ids confirmed unknown by API validation. `unadvertised_facets` records attempted ids absent from a fetched vocabulary, which need not be invalid. Local MCP validation failures do not enter API latency percentiles.

Completed, failed and capped runs all enter the success denominator. Expected-match rates include only cases with approved expectations and a parsed judgement. The gap list is sourced catalogue analysis of requirements the current contract cannot express completely. It distinguishes missing task interpretation or quantization-specific fit from unavailable evidence. A 503 alone is not a capability gap.

The committed report is a public fixture run. Live reports can contain prompts, corporate policies, available providers and API replies. Keep future live reports in the private checkout or a private output directory. This PR adds no workflow or schedule.

The sole production exception is a single keyless vocabulary smoke:

```sh
python -m qa.agent_harness --smoke-vocabulary
```

It sends exactly one GET to `https://api.modelspec.dev/v1/vocabulary`, attaches no key, follows no redirects, and stores only counts, snapshot, status and latency. It does not run any scenarios.

## Grow the catalogue past 100

Add one YAML file per scenario under `qa/scenarios`, with `id`, `family`, `persona`, `request`, `constraints`, `expected`, and `rubric`. Use `sources` for provenance and `prompt` for F2. Use `gaps` only for a demonstrated contract limitation; each entry needs `reason`, `suggested_fix`, and `source`.

Copy established expected rows verbatim from `tests/recall/expected.yaml` and set `expected_source: tests/recall/expected.yaml#Qxx`. Keep `expected: null` for every other scenario. A shortlist returned by the API or a judge is not independent ground truth.

Add at least 26 variants across real personas and constraints to reach 100. Useful axes include ambiguous and complete hardware descriptions, exhausted subscription plans, approved-provider intersections, contradictory policy requirements, prompt languages, output formats, workloads and no-feasible budgets. Preserve meaningful differences between requests. For a new variant without an existing recall or template recipe, add `fixture_spec` containing a valid structured Spec for the recorder. This field never enters agent context and is not an expected answer. Add successful, failing and abstaining replay cases, regenerate fixtures, and run the offline tests. Avoid real private prompts in this public catalogue.
