# MODEL-458-BILL-A verification

Base: `5dd0eb5a16637d254c23f2903a5b97fb134ef9c3`.
Final revision: the PR head containing this evidence; its full SHA is recorded in the executor handoff.

Python 3.14.4; pytest 9.1.1; Git 2.50.1. Tests use local stores and signed fixtures.

## AUD-03-F1

Rotation uses a durable staged transition and returns one funded successor.
The source remains funded until successor metadata is written. Pending work
resumes after metadata interruptions and Durable Object reconstruction.
Only hashes and transition metadata are persisted.

The two supplied checks and two initial permanent controls failed before the
change. Both supplied checks pass after the change. Detailed local output is
kept out of public evidence. Recovery controls cover metadata writes before
and after acceptance, independent clients, replay and persisted progress.

Focused command, run serially from the worktree:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=$PWD /Users/terbeest/dev/modelspec/.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_billing.py tests/test_credits.py tests/test_credits_do.py tests/test_billing_refunds.py
```

Result: 137 passed, exit 0.

No production requests, payments, deployment or provider calls were made.
No production flags, prices, plans, legal text or frozen data changed.

## AUD-03-F2

Renewals retain the stored current subscription key. Failed payments and
subscription expiry update that same key. The supplied check failed before
the change and passes after it. Three permanent controls failed before the
change and pass after it.

```sh
PYTHONPATH=$PWD /Users/terbeest/dev/modelspec/.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_billing.py tests/test_pricing_v2.py
```

Result: 183 passed, exit 0.

## AUD-03-F3

Subscription status and invoice billing periods are retained separately.
Sequential delivery permutations preserve current entitlement, including
cancellation recorded before a purchase entitlement. Checkout links preserve
the current invoice plan. Legacy records remain readable.

The two supplied checks and 12 permanent controls failed before the change
and pass after it. The billing/pricing command above passed 195 tests, exit 0.
The controls cover both invoice event timestamps, paid recovery, cancellation,
checkout linking and replay. This verifies sequential event permutations;
concurrent webhook ordering through KV was not measured.

## AUD-03-F4

Purchase claims select one owner through the ledger Durable Object before
key issuance. Metadata completes before funding. The existing payment claim
records completion atomically with funding. Retries preserve the funded
owner, and completed records retain only a completion marker. The refund
Durable Object fixture now supplies its ACCESS binding; assertions remain intact.

The supplied check, two permanent billing controls and four initial Durable
Object controls failed before the change and pass after it. Added controls
cover subscriptions and packs, independent clients, metadata interruptions,
funding interruptions, restart, replay and absent ledger bindings. Review
also added a rotation control that preserves current subscription status
when pending work resumes. The legal record-naming check passes.

```sh
PYTHONPATH=$PWD /Users/terbeest/dev/modelspec/.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_billing.py tests/test_billing_refunds.py tests/test_credits_do.py tests/test_credits.py tests/test_pricing_v2.py tests/test_friends_billing.py tests/test_legal.py
```

Result: 375 passed, exit 0.
