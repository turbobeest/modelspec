Part of the [Arena Elo](arena_elo.md) family.

## What it measures

The style-controlled Arena rating computed only from battles whose prompt Arena labels as instruction following. The classifier's exact criteria are not established from a source read for this page.

## Reading the numbers

This is a preference, not a verifier. IFBench checks whether stated constraints were met; this board says which answer a person preferred when the prompt carried instructions. ModelSpec does not use the raw rating. Arena ratings are Bradley-Terry scores on the Elo scale, so only gaps carry meaning. The ranker converts a rating to twice its expected win rate against this board's leader on the pinned snapshot (1513.49 on 2026-09-13), which puts the leader at 100. A value read on any other date does not count. Votes are crowd preferences from Arena users, so a high rating means people preferred the answers, not that the answers were checked.

## Source and attribution

Values come only from LMArena's Hugging Face dataset [lmarena-ai/leaderboard-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmarena-ai/leaderboard-dataset), licensed **CC BY 4.0**, never from lmarena.ai itself. ModelSpec reads the `text_style_control` subset, category `instruction_following`, `latest` split, at dataset revision `1880dbebff5b`. Arena states this board's publish date as 2026-09-13.
